# Tasks

This repository contains a collection of tasks that can be optionally implemented in PHP using the CGI module. Each task is designed to enhance your understanding and proficiency in PHP programming. Below is a brief overview of each task:

1. **Run XAMPP Application Control Panel**: Set up the XAMPP application control panel, start the Apache HTTP server, and test if the server is running correctly by accessing a PHP script via the web browser.

2. **Even Number Printing**: Create a PHP script to display even numbers within a specified range, using either a for or while loop. Display consecutive numbers on separate lines.

3. **Printing Even Numbers from a Given Range**: Modify the script to print even numbers from a user-defined range, provided via the GET method.

4. **Printing Even Numbers from a Given Range in JSON Format**: Extend the script to output even numbers from a user-defined range in JSON format, using the json_encode() function.

5. **JSON Format Parser**: Use the json_decode() function to create and print an object variable from data presented in JSON format.

6. **Simple PHP Calculator**: Develop a basic PHP calculator script capable of performing arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) for two arguments, along with factorial operation for one argument. Validate input parameters before performing operations and print results in JSON format.

7. **Read from File**: Implement a script to read and display file names and contents from a specified folder using the scandir() and file_get_contents() functions.

8. **Save to File**: Create a class representing parameters and types, populate it with data, and save it to a file in JSON format using the file_put_contents() function. Read data from the file, modify the value field, and overwrite the file.

9. **Class for Embedded Device I/O**: Develop a class describing the input and output of an embedded device, including digital and analog I/O states. Extend the classes with additional information and implement procedures for reading sensor data and performing read and write operations on selected values using the GET method.

Feel free to explore each task and implement them according to your learning objectives and preferences. Happy coding!
